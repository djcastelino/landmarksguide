**Title:**
Built an AI Travel Companion with 126 Landmarks, Audio Tours, and Daily Geography Challenges

---

**Post Body:**

Hey everyone! I've been building **Geonauts Guide** - an AI-powered travel companion app, and I'd love to share what I've created so far.

## What it does:

🗺️ **Interactive Landmark Map** - 126 iconic landmarks across the globe (80 man-made wonders + 46 natural wonders). Each one has AI-generated audio narrations that bring the history and stories to life.

🎙️ **AI Audio Tours** - 2-3 minute narrated experiences for every landmark. The AI adds witty observations that connect historical facts to modern life (like "It took 22 years to complete the Taj Mahal - which suddenly makes your kitchen renovation timeline look downright speedy!")

✈️ **AI Route Planner** - Planning a multi-city trip? The AI suggests optimized routes and gives conversational travel advice.

🌍 **Daily City Guess** - A geography game that gives you clues about a mystery city each day. Kind of addictive tbh.

## Tech Stack:
- React + Vite frontend
- Azure TTS for natural-sounding audio (random male/female voices)
- Groq API with Llama 3.3 70B for AI generation
- n8n workflows for the AI backend
- Deployed on Vercel

## Why I built it:
I was tired of generic travel guides that read like encyclopedias. I wanted something that feels like having a knowledgeable friend who actually makes history interesting and helps you plan trips without the information overload.

## What's working well:
- The audio narrations are surprisingly engaging (people have told me they listen even when not traveling)
- The daily city guess game has good retention
- Route planner gives genuinely useful advice without trying to book anything

## What I'm still working on:
- Adding more landmarks (aiming for 200+)
- Improving mobile UX for smaller screens
- Building out social sharing features

## Challenges I ran into:
- Getting the AI's "wit" just right - not too forced, not too bland
- Balancing audio quality vs. generation speed
- Making sure the app works smoothly on mobile (especially the map view)

Would love to hear your feedback! Also happy to answer any questions about the tech stack or implementation.

## Alternative Shorter Version (if character limit):

**Title:**

**Body:**

Built **Geonauts Guide** - an AI-powered travel app with:

- ✈️ Smart route planner for multi-city trips  
- 🌍 Daily geography challenge game

**Tech:** React, Azure TTS, Llama 3.3 70B, n8n, Vercel

The AI adds witty observations to make history engaging ("The Great Wall took 2,000 years to build - your 2-year project doesn't seem so bad now!")

**Biggest challenge:** Getting the AI's tone right - informative but not boring, witty but not forced.
